Android Nanodegree Projects
===========================

This repository holds my work done so far towards the Android Nanodegree offered
by Udacity.  This application will run on Android phones and will launch various
projects that are part of the nanodegree curriculum.

Where possible, I am licensing my work under the GPLv3+.  Some of this work may
be provided by the organizers or Google and thus is not mine to license, so
please be wary if you wish to use this code in a project of your own.
